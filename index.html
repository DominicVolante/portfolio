        <h3>About Dominic</h3>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for people, and helping those in need. I've
          spent the past seven years working as a Police Officer in upstate New
          York, and during that time I worked hard to affect change in my
          community and learned a ton of useful skills. While I was able to help
          many people and enjoyed community policing, I wasn’t able to incite as
          much change as I wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being inspired by amazing engineers such as Iddris Sandu, I
          realized a potential to reach further by learning software
          engineering. I developed an interest in coding at the age of 13 after
          I built my first computer and programmed a few HTML-based games. I've
          always maintained a strong interest in science and technology. My main
          interests are in general AI, robotics software, and space studies, and
          I regularly scan articles to keep up with the ever advancing tech
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now a student at
          <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> and I
          plan to implement the skills I've learned as a Police Officer into the
          tech world. I have a passion for helping people in any way that I can,
          and I hope to be able create software that can do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a software engineer who is excited to take on a
          challenge, please feel free to reach out. I’m actively looking for new
          opportunities and I look forward to working with experienced
          engineers.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Tuck is a symptom tracking web app for people to take note and
              keep track of symptoms they're experiencing. I built Tuck to help
              me keep track of symptoms that my dog was having to help me
              diagnose his issue with his vet. The app was built to be simple
              and quick to use so that symptoms could be tracked easily when
              they happened. Tuck is built using React with Hooks, and Node.js
              with router.

            <p>
              Cari's List is a collection of eco-friendly products. Every
              product has been meticulously researched so that users don't have
              to do the research on their own. Every product page has a tab with
              a short, consice product description, and a tab on how to properly
              dispose of the product and its packaging. I built Cari's List to
              practice building a full stack application from ground zero using
              React and Node.js with PostgreSQL.

            <p>
              The Patwa app is a demo application on how to use the spaced
              repetition technique to help study a language, in this case,
              Patwa. I built this app to practice using the linked list
              datastructure on the back-end with Node.js, and traverse through
              it with algorithms on the front-end with React.
