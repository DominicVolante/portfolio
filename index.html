      <h3>About Dominic</h3>
      <p>I've always had a passion for people, and helping those in need. I've spent the past seven years working as a Police Officer in upstate New York, and during that time I worked hard to affect change in my community and learned a ton of useful skills. While I was able to help many people and enjoyed community policing, I wasn’t able to incite as much change as I wanted to.</p>
      <p>After being inspired by amazing engineers such as Iddris Sandu, I realized a potential to reach further by learning software engineering. I developed an interest in coding at the age of 13 after I built my first computer and programmed a few HTML-based games. I've always maintained a strong interest in science and technology. My main interests are in general AI, robotics software, and space studies, and I regularly scan articles to keep up with the ever advancing tech world.</p>
      <p> I am now a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> and I plan to implement the skills I've learned as a Police Officer into the tech world. I have a passion for helping people in any way that I can, and I hope to be able create software that can do just that.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a software engineer who is excited to take on a challenge, please feel free to reach out. I’m actively looking for new opportunities and I look forward to working with experienced engineers.</p>
