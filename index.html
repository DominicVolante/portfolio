      <h3>About Dominic</h3>
      <p>I developed an interest in coding at the age of 13 after I built my first computer and programmed a few HTML-based games. After college, I wanted to serve my community and spent seven years working as a Police Officer in New York. During that time I worked hard to affect change in my community and learned a ton. While I was able to help many people and enjoyed community policing, I wasn’t able to incite as much change as I wanted to.</p>
      <p>I've always maintained a strong interest in science and technology and, after being inspired by amazing engineers such as Iddris Sandu, I realized a potential to reach further by learning software engineering.</p>
      <p> I am now a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> and I plan to create platforms that will help people project their message and seek the help they need.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a software engineer who is excited to take on a challenge, please reach out. I’m actively looking for new opportunities and I look forward to working with experienced engineers.</p>
